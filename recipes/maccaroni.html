            <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>.5 cup milk</li>
            <li>1.5 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>8 ounce package cream cheese</li>
            <li>.5 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring 
                occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 minutes. 
                Drain.</li>
            <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water 
                to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a 
                boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until tender, 5 to 6
                 minutes. Place cauliflower in a blender or food processor; 
                 blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Coat a large saucepan with non-stick cooking spray; place 
                over medium heat. Add oil and flour; cook, stirring 
                constantly, until a thick paste forms, 1 to 2 minutes. 
                Add milk; cook and stir until mixture thickens, 3 to 4 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix cauliflower, Cheddar cheese, cream cheese, salt, and 
                pepper into milk mixture; stir until sauce is smooth. Fold 
                macaroni into sauce.</li>
        </ol>
