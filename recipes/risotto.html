        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1.5 ounces prosciutto</li>
            <li>1 large shallot, minced</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>2 chanterelle mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup arborio rice</li>
            <li>1 cup red wine</li>
            <li>3 cups beef stock, or more as needed, divided</li>
            <li>.5 cup arugula</li>
            <li>.3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium 
                heat; cook prosciutto until edges begin to curl and fat is 
                rendered, 2 to 3 minutes. Add shallot and cook until 
                fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until 
                fragrant, about 1 minute. Add mushrooms and cook for 30 
                seconds.
            </li>
            <li>Cook and stir rice into prosciutto mixture, stirring 
                continually, until rice is translucent around edges, 1 to 2 
                minutes. Pour red wine into rice mixture; cook, stirring 
                every 30 seconds, until wine is absorbed, about 5 minutes. 
                Stir 1 cup broth into rice mixture, cooking and stirring 
                until broth is almost completely absorbed, 3 to 5 minutes. 
                Continue adding 1 cup broth at a time, stirring constantly, 
                until rice is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Mix arugula, Parmesan cheese, thyme, and black pepper 
                into rice mixture; cook and stir until cheese is melted, 
                2 to 3 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
